USD-FIAT Gateway Prototype
---------------------------
Objective: Enable users especially merchants to be able to buy/sell NANO
directly from a platform by connecting their Coinbase account with OAuth2.
This will boost adoption by removing the work needed to purchasing
and securely storing alt coins like NANO.

Transaction Pipeline:
Currency conversions: USD -> LTC -> BTC -> NANO
Currency Location Flow: Coinbase -> Binance -> User's Nano address

Brief Summary:

- Allow user to choose how much USD he wishes to use to purchase NANO from
  his Coinbase account along with an approximation on how much NANO he will
  receive.

- Trigger an AWS lambda function through an API gateway that uses USD from
  user's Coinbase account to purchase Litecoin and then send the Litecoin to
  Binance (since Litecoin is the fastest coin on Coinbase).

- Use a Coinbase webhook to alert another AWS lambda function when the withdrawal
  is complete in order to convert LTC to BTC to then NANO on Binance.

- The same lambda function as above or a different once can then withdraw
  the Nano to the user's Nano address (The address can be stored/retrieved from a database)

- Done! Display on the user's screen a complete, transparent record of this
  transaction e.g., transaction fees, timestamps, and final amount of Nano recieved.

Foreword About My Code:
- This code is a simplified version of this procedure. Due note that a financial
  pipeline like this needs to be thoroughly tested.
- I organized the operations of functions into paths of Node.js express servers.
  These need to be converted to be able to be compatible with Lambda functions.
- I only account for the purchase of Nano but not the sale of Nano.

Future thoughts:
- There are ways to streamline this process e.g., using a pool fund to instantly
  transfer Nano to users on purchase, keeping USDT on Binance that can be converted
  into Nano and sent to user on purchase, and more, but these require scale
  in order to be successful.
